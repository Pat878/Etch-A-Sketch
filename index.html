This project gave me a bit of a headache. First I struggled to create a grid of divs without copying and pasting. I figured that out, and I found the hover effect to be easy. But then I really struggled with resizing the div. I had an idea about storing the size of the grid/blocks in variables, but I felt like I was going about it the wrong way. I did some more searching, and I found this codepen: http://codepen.io/prestonhalley/pen/jWdvvz by Preston Halley. His project showed me how to update the grid size while keeping the blocks inside of the container. Here is my first attempt: http://codepen.io/pat878/pen/PWYazp. Thank you, Preston Halley, for showing me the light!
